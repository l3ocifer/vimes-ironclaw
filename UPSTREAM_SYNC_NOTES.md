# Upstream sync — manual resolution required

Generated: 2026-07-22T08:00:08Z
Upstream:   https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw.git @ main
Upstream commit: 59afb4f9e7b598369165f9221bf0fd4817518ddb

The automated 3-way merge on top of `origin/main` produced conflicts.
The merge was aborted before any conflict markers were committed, so
this branch currently contains only this notes file on top of
`origin/main` — that is by design.

## Conflicting paths

```
src/agent/agent_loop.rs
src/agent/commands.rs
src/agent/heartbeat.rs
src/main.rs
```

## How to resolve

```bash
git fetch origin "chore/upstream-sync-2026-07-22-59afb4f" && git switch "chore/upstream-sync-2026-07-22-59afb4f"
git remote add upstream https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw.git 2>/dev/null || true
git fetch upstream main
git merge upstream/main
# resolve, then:
git rm UPSTREAM_SYNC_NOTES.md
git commit
git push --force origin "chore/upstream-sync-2026-07-22-59afb4f"
```

Then update the PR body / drop draft state and merge.

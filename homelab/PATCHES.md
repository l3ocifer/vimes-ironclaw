# Local patches vs upstream nearai/ironclaw

Track non-additive changes. Additive changes under `homelab/` don't
need entries.

## Active patches

None. The one former patch was retired by the 2026-07-26 Reborn adoption
(below) because the code they patched no longer exists upstream.

## Retired patches

### heartbeat-tool-exec (retired 2026-07-26)

- **Files**: `src/agent/heartbeat.rs`, `src/agent/agent_loop.rs`, `src/agent/commands.rs`, `src/main.rs`
- **Was**: upstream's v1 heartbeat turn rendered tool calls but never
  executed them, so autonomous cron/heartbeat turns could not act.
- **Retired because**: upstream deleted the entire v1 legacy monolith
  these files belonged to. Reborn models heartbeat as a first-class
  `HeartbeatRequest` routed through `turn_run_executor`, the same executor
  that runs normal turns, so the gap the patch closed does not exist in
  the new architecture.

### `crates/ironclaw_skills/src/registry.rs` — sha256 hex format (retired 2026-07-17)

Upstream used `format!("sha256:{:x}", result)` which stopped compiling
with rustc 1.92 + edition 2024 + generic-array 0.14 (E0277). Our
`homelab/Dockerfile` carried a build-time `sed` swapping it for a
byte-iter hex encode. Upstream now uses `hex::encode` in registry.rs,
so the patch (and its Dockerfile `RUN`) was dropped with the
2026-07-17 upstream merge (`merge: upstream ironclaw @ 81dbdc6d0`).

## 2026-07-26: v1 → Reborn cutover

Upstream deleted the v1 legacy monolith (root `src/`, package
`ironclaw_legacy`, binary `ironclaw-legacy`) and renamed
`crates/ironclaw_reborn_cli` to package `ironclaw`, producing a binary
still called `ironclaw`. Same binary name, different runtime. What
changed on our side:

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| args | `--no-onboard run` | `serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000` |
| config | `/etc/ironclaw/openclaw.json` | `$IRONCLAW_REBORN_HOME/config.toml` (`homelab/config/reborn-config.toml`, seeded onto the state PVC by an initContainer) |
| state | `/data` (SQLite sessions) | CNPG Postgres `ironclaw_vimes`, via `IRONCLAW_REBORN_POSTGRES_URL` |
| health | `/api/health` | `/api/health` (unchanged) |
| LLM | `LLM_BACKEND` + `LLM_BASE_URL`/`LLM_MODEL`/`LLM_API_KEY` | `[llm.default]` with `provider_id = "openai_compatible"`, which reads the same `LLM_BASE_URL`/`LLM_API_KEY` |

No new secrets were needed: `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRETS_MASTER_KEY` and
`A2A_BEARER_TOKEN` already existed in the `vimes-secrets` SealedSecret and
are mapped to the `IRONCLAW_REBORN_*` names the runtime expects.

### Follow-up: the cutover did not build (fixed 2026-07-26)

The first cutover changed the args, config and manifests but left
`homelab/Dockerfile` as the v1 build, which still copied `src/`, `build.rs`,
`tools-src/` and `channels-src/` — paths upstream deleted with the monolith.
Every build after the merge therefore failed at the COPY step, and because a
failed build pushes nothing, the `:homelab` tag kept resolving to the *old v1
image*. ArgoCD reported Synced and Healthy throughout, on a pod that had been
running for 13 hours. Two lessons, both cheap to apply next time:

- A green ArgoCD and a Running pod say nothing about whether the image you
  intended to ship exists. Check the tag's digest against the deployed digest.
- The build had never been exercised, because `homelab-build-check.yml` is a
  *pull_request* gate and the cutover went straight to main. Push the build to
  a PR when the Dockerfile changes, or accept that main is the first test.

The Dockerfile is now a mirror of upstream's root Dockerfile plus our runtime
tooling. Three things about the Reborn build differ from the v1 one and are
easy to get wrong on the next sync:

- the target is `--package ironclaw --profile dist`, so the binary is at
  `target/dist/ironclaw`, not `target/release/`;
- `crates/ironclaw_webui` builds a frontend during `cargo build`, so the Rust
  builder needs node + pnpm (upstream copies them out of a `node:22` stage);
- the runtime stage needs `docker/reborn/*.toml` and `entrypoint.sh`.

Two config-side bugs came out of the same review, neither of which the image
fix would have covered on its own:

- `homelab/config/reborn-config.toml` had no `[storage]` section. The
  `hosted-single-tenant` profile requires it — it is what points the runtime at
  `IRONCLAW_REBORN_POSTGRES_URL` and `IRONCLAW_REBORN_SECRET_MASTER_KEY` — and
  the entrypoint exits with a clear error when it is missing. Added, along with
  `runner.worker_count = 0` to match upstream's guidance for this profile.
- the Deployment set `command: ["ironclaw"]`, which replaces the image
  ENTRYPOINT and so skipped upstream's entrypoint entirely — including that
  `[storage]` check. Removed; `args:` alone now flows through to
  `exec ironclaw "$@"`, and tini is back as PID 1.

### What the first real Reborn boot demanded

Neither of these is discoverable from the config schema — the runtime only
rejects them while assembling, so they cost a crash-loop each:

- `IRONCLAW_REBORN_POSTGRES_RESOURCE_GOVERNOR_SINGLETON=true`. A required
  operator assertion that this process is the only resource-governor for its
  database. Setting it to `false` is also an error; the runtime wants the
  affirmative statement. True here because vimes owns `ironclaw_vimes` alone
  and `replicas: 1` + `strategy: Recreate` means no second pod overlaps —
  **scaling this Deployment past 1, or switching to RollingUpdate, silently
  invalidates it.**
- a TLS decision. Reborn refuses a remote Postgres that is neither
  TLS-verified nor explicitly waived, and its `require` is stricter than
  libpq's: it validates the full chain *and* the hostname against rustls'
  native roots, with no CA-file setting on the connection. CNPG signs with a
  per-cluster CA in `homelab-pg-ca` in the `databases` namespace, which a Pod
  in `agents-shared` cannot mount, so this first shipped on cleartext
  (`DATABASE_SSLMODE=disable` + `IRONCLAW_REBORN_ALLOW_REMOTE_POSTGRES_CLEAR_TEXT=true`).

### Verified TLS, and why it takes an initContainer

Cleartext is now gone. Two pieces were needed:

1. **The CA has to reach the namespace.** `cnpg-ca-sync`
   (homelab `argocd/apps/_agents/cnpg-ca-sync`) mirrors `databases/homelab-pg-ca`
   into `agents-shared` every 6 hours, copying `ca.crt` only — CNPG keeps the
   CA *private key* in that same secret, and replicating it would let anything
   reading this namespace mint certs the server trusts. A scheduled copy rather
   than a sealed one because CNPG rotates the CA every 90 days.
2. **The CA has to be in the trust store the process reads.** Since there is no
   CA-file knob, the lever is `SSL_CERT_FILE`, which `rustls-native-certs`
   honours. But setting it to the CNPG CA alone *replaces* the public roots and
   would break every outbound HTTPS call in the container. So the
   `build-ca-bundle` initContainer concatenates the image's own
   `ca-certificates.crt` with the CNPG CA into an emptyDir, and `SSL_CERT_FILE`
   points at the result. It runs on the agent image, not busybox, precisely
   because it needs that image's public bundle.

`DATABASE_SSLMODE=require` then overrides the `?sslmode=disable` still baked
into the `DATABASE_URL` secret — the env var is applied to the parsed DSN, so
the secret never had to be resealed. Verified before rollout with a
credential-free probe from `agents-shared`: `sslmode=verify-full` against
`homelab-pg-rw.databases.svc.cluster.local` reached the auth stage ("no
password supplied"), and `openssl s_client` returned `Verify return code: 0`.

Two failure modes to recognise:

- **`UnknownIssuer` on boot** — the bundle is missing the CNPG root. Check that
  `cnpg-ca-sync` last ran and that its output actually changed the secret.
- **CA rotation** — the bundle is built once, at pod start. When CNPG rotates,
  the sync job updates the secret but running pods keep the old bundle; they
  need a restart. The job logs `CA ROTATED` when this happens.

Worth Vimes's own attention either way: this is the security agent, and
for the first hours of the Reborn cutover it ran its state store in
cleartext.

### Do not sync from `upstream/staging` any more (2026-07-26)

The pre-Reborn sync procedure for this repo merged `upstream/staging`. That
branch is now a trap: its tip is **2026-05-06** and its tree still contains the
v1 monolith (`src/`, `build.rs`, `channels-src/`). Merging it reports as a
one-commit fast-forward — the misleadingly small `git rev-list --count
HEAD..upstream/staging` — but resolves as a pile of modify/delete conflicts
whose "resolution" would restore every v1 file the Reborn cutover removed, and
the homelab Dockerfile would then build the wrong tree.

The live line is **`upstream/main`**. Verify before every sync rather than
trusting the count:

    git log -1 --format='%ci' upstream/main
    git ls-tree --name-only upstream/main src/     # must be empty post-Reborn

An `src/` that is *not* empty means the ref predates the Reborn cutover.

### Not carried over — verify before trusting these

`openclaw.json` also configured things with no Reborn equivalent wired up
yet. Upstream's own cutover note is explicit that it "does not perform a v1
data migration". Treat these as unverified after the cutover:

- **fleet bus** — `fleet.databaseUrlEnv` / `notifyChannel: fleet_events_new`
  and the inbound severity predicate.
- **MCP servers** declared in `openclaw.json`.
- **cron / scheduled turns** — Reborn expresses these as triggers.
- **A2A peers** for cross-agent handoff.
- **existing session history** in the `/data` SQLite store; Reborn starts
  from its Postgres schema.

`openclaw.json` is still generated and mounted, unused by the runtime, so
it stays as the reference for re-wiring these and so a rollback is a pure
image + args revert.
